Source of Skript addon TuSKe.

I only updated the source in 1.7 version, why? I was little lazy and I wanted to only upload it without my codes when I was starting
(which means I will fix any huge code mistakes).

Also, there is a `SkUnityUpdater` class that let you check for new updates and download it directly from your addon thread.
But, I will remake it as `GitHubUpdater`.
